# menagerie

Menagerie is a prototype of a Device Management System for IoT devices.

With Menagerie you keep an inventory of your (hardware) devices, as well as help you in keeping track of their location and status over time as well as having a centralized repository for their configurations.

It can be used with it's companion iOs [scanner application][ios-app] to simplify the workflow by scanning the QR that Menagerie generates for Locations and Devices.
